# e2e-cypress-pom-cucumber-allure

This repository is the result of my independent project to train certain things in E2E QA Automation.

I spent 2 days on the realization and setting up this project. JavaScript programming language was used to write the code.

The Web Shop that I chose for testing is [djaksport](https://www.djaksport.com/), and I had no intention of harming the company itself, but only to increase and improve my skills.

Side information: To use the application in a special environment the author accepts no responsibility if you cause damage to third parties

### Execution of tests in CI using GitHub Actions
***
[The results of the last test execution are visible at this link](https://pavlovic-bojan.github.io/e2e-cypress-pom-cucumber-allure/)
At the moment when the project was created, all the tests were passing, but in the meantime, if the owners changed something on the webshop and some tests failed, maybe all the tests failed due to changes in the webshop itself. I have no influence, nor is the company obliged to inform me about changes, because this project is only a demo project.
